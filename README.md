This Java-based console application simulates a car rental system, providing users with the ability to rent and return vehicles. The system incorporates essential features for effective car rental management.
Key Features:

1.Vehicle Management:

Create and maintain a database of available vehicles, including their type (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck), model, rental rate, and availability status.
Allow for vehicle updates and deletions as needed.
2.Customer Management:

Create and manage customer profiles, storing information such as name, contact details, and rental history.
3.Rental Process:

Enable customers to select and rent available vehicles based on their preferences.
Calculate rental fees based on the rental duration and the vehicle's rental rate.
Generate rental agreements for each transaction.
4.Return Process:

Allow customers to return rented vehicles and record the return details.
Calculate any additional charges or refunds based on the return conditions.
5.Reporting:

Generate various reports, such as:
Daily, weekly, and monthly rental summaries
Customer rental history
Vehicle utilization statistics
Technical Implementation:

Data Structures: Utilize appropriate data structures (e.g., arrays, lists, maps) to efficiently store and manage vehicle and customer information.
Input/Output: Employ console-based input and output for user interaction.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to prevent unexpected system behavior and provide informative error messages.
Modular Design: Organize the code into well-defined modules (classes, methods) to improve code readability, maintainability, and reusability.
Potential Enhancements:

GUI Interface: Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience and provide a more intuitive interaction.
Database Integration: Integrate the system with a database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store and manage data persistently.
Payment Processing: Incorporate a payment gateway to enable online payments for rentals.
Location Tracking: Implement GPS tracking to monitor vehicle locations and ensure timely returns.
This project provides a solid foundation for a car rental system and can be further expanded to incorporate additional features and functionalities based on specific requirements.
